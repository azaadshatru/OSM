Configuration of OSM Maps to display correct Maps of India with disputed boundaries
Please see uploaded Word Doc "Configuration of OSM Server to rednder correct map of India.docx" for step by step process of first configuring the tile server, and then configuring the geojson file to correct the Indian boundaries.
Request you to download the latest india-latest-osm.pbf file and india-osm.geojson files at the time of actual implementation.
My Sincere thanks to Arun Ganesh <https://twitter.com/planemad?lang=en> for his help, without which it was not possible for me to configure the correct maps of India.
All files used/edited to make the maps works are uploaded here for your reference. They may look different in your case.
